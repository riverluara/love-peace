## Executive Summary

So far we have finalised on most design elements of the game. We plan to get most of the assets from the public domain. We have decided on a basic architecture on how to implement the code for the game.  

### Purpose
> Provide a very brief statement about the project and the most important user group and user goals.
Statement: The game aims to appease teenagers and young adults alike by giving an adrenaline pumping fast and furious action racing game.
                     
User group: 
            Teenagers and Young Adults;
            Hardcore racers;
            Fans who like to have interest in action and racing with strategizing their moves;
                       
User goal: Users can play the game that offers players the best of both racing as well as shooting action.

(Like.. what users want to get from our game?)

### Glossary and Acronyms
> Provide a table of terms and acronyms.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Rapier	 | Small and light category spaceship |
| Eviscerator		| Medium category spaceship |
| Goliath | Heavy category space|


## Requirements
We would require the following to be able to create the game:
* A game engine.
* Art Assets.
* Sound Assets.
* Animations.8-12 months of development including play testing and debugging.

### Features

This section describes the main features of the game.

> In this section you do not need to be exhaustive and list every story.  Focus on top-level features and maybe Epics and *critical* Stories.

### Non-functional Requirements
> Key NFRs and technical constraints

* Creating game does pose a technical challenge for the developers.
* The project is also constrained to using Unityâ€™s physics engine as the team lacks the knowledge to create one on their own.
* The game may need a lot more time than anticipated given the lack of technical experience on the team.
